                        An upgraded version of Dream Nail after collecting 1800 Essence and returning to the seer.
                        This allows access to dreams and memories that were previously hidden. The Awoken Dream Nail can
                        be used on the corpse of the Kingsmould in the Palace Grounds. This grants entry to the White
                        Palace.
                        Furthermore, the Awoken Dream Nail can be used to view the Dream Nail dialogue of the Shade
                        Cloak creature in the Abyss. This creature has different Dream Nail dialogue depending on
                        whether Void Heart has been obtained.

                        Obtain after collecting 900 Essence and returning to the seer.
                        This allows The Knight to place a Dreamgate at a location, then warp to it from anywhere. Only
                        one Dreamgate can be placed at any time, and placing a new gate removes the previous one.
                        Warping consumes 1 Essence. A Dreamgate can be warped to indefinitely, as long as the Knight has
                        enough Essence.
