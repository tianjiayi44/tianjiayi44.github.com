        <div class="ms-3 god_master_content">Godmaster is the last of the three free content packs planned for Hollow
            Knight.
            It was initially revealed as Gods & Glory along with its content on January 31st, 2018, but renamed to
            Godmaster on August 15th, 2018 due to a trademark conflict with the mobile game Gods and Glory published by
            Wargaming. It was released on August 23rd, 2018.
            This last content pack added an endgame quest and fighting challenges, several characters and secret areas,
            more Delicate Flower recipients and additional music, along with some remixes.

            <div class="ms-3">Pantheons are a mechanic added to Godhome. They feature a select set of bosses to combat
                before
                reaching the "Peak" of each Pantheon and facing the unique final boss of each challenge. Most bosses,
                with the exception of the final bosses, need to be defeated outside Godhome first before the Pantheon
                can be accessed that contains those bosses.
                Completing the first three Pantheons also unlocks Godseeker Mode.
