    <div class="title mt-3 ms-3">How To Access:</div>
    <p class="ms-3">The initial way to access the Colosseum of Fools is to climb to the top of the western chasm of Kingdom's Edge. A
        cavern in the northwest of this chasm eventually leads to the Colosseum of Fools.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="title mt-3 ms-3">Trials:</div>
    <p class="ms-3">In order to unlock a Trial, the Knight must have defeated the previous trial (except for the first Trial) and pay
        a sum of Geo that increases for each Trial. Once the initial sum of Geo is paid to unlock the Trial, the Knight
        can challenge the Trial as many times as they want for free. After completing a Trial for the first time, a pin
        with the head of the Knight attached appears stuck on top of each of the Trial boards.</p>
    <div class="title mt-3 ms-3">Trial Of The Warrior:</div>
    <p class="ms-3">The first and easiest of the three Trials, the waves are slow and the enemies easy to manage.
        Requires 100 geo to unlock. Upon completing it for the first time, it rewards a Charm Notch, 1000-1024 geo, and
        the Warrior achievement. Subsequent victories reward only 1000-1024 geo.
    </p>

    </div>
    <div class="title mt-3 ms-3">Trial of the Conqueror:</div>
    <p class="ms-3">The second Trial, harder than the first, introduces the no ground mechanic of wall-jumping and mid-air combat
        without healing.
        Requires 450 geo to unlock. Upon completing it for the first time, it rewards a Pale Ore, 2000-2020 geo, and the
        Conqueror achievement. Subsequent victories reward only 2000-2020 geo.
    </p>

        <img src="colosseumoffools.image/image 103.png" width="20%">
    </div>
    <div class="title mt-3 ms-3">Trial of the Fool:</div>
    <p class="ms-3">Last of the three Trials, the waves come at a brutally fast pace at times and the enemies spawned are far
        tougher, it combines just about every mechanic from the first two Trials.
        Requires 800 geo to unlock. Upon completing it for the first time, it rewards 3000-3020 geo, and the Fool
        achievement. Subsequent victories also reward 3000-3020 geo.
